        <h2>What Are OTT Ad Platforms?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>{keywordMain}</strong> (Over-The-Top advertising platforms)
          enable brands to deliver ads directly to viewers through internet-based
          streaming services like Hulu, YouTube TV, or Roku. These platforms
          bypass traditional cable providers, allowing brands to target users
          based on behavior, interests, and geography. As a result,{" "}

          control, scalability, and analytics.

        <p>
          The main appeal of <strong>{keywordSecondary}</strong> lies in their
          ability to merge storytelling with precise audience targeting. Instead

          Modern audiences value authenticity. That’s why brands now repurpose
          influencer clips and UGC content directly into{" "}

          commercials, viewers see creators they already follow endorsing a
