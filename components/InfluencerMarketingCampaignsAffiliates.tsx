        <h2>What Are Influencer Marketing Campaigns?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>{keyword}</strong> are structured strategies where brands
          partner with influencers to promote products or services. These
          campaigns can include nano influencers sharing authentic experiences
          or larger creators producing branded content. When combined with
          affiliate links, every engagement can be tracked, making campaigns
          more performance-driven.

        <p>
          One of the fastest-growing trends in{" "}
          <strong>{keyword}</strong> is integrating affiliate programs. Instead
          of paying influencers solely upfront, brands can also reward them for
          each sale or lead they generate. This hybrid approach motivates
          influencers to deliver stronger results and ensures brands only pay
          for actual performance.
