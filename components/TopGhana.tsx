          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            As the demand for cryptocurrencies grows, Momo provides a trusted bridge between cash and digital assets like Bitcoin.

            <li>Always double-check the Bitcoin wallet address.</li>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Bitcoin Adoption is Growing Worldwide</h2>
  <p>
    Bitcoin isn’t just growing in Ghana — it’s becoming a global phenomenon. Countries across Africa, Latin America, and Asia are seeing more people turn to Bitcoin as a way to store value, protect against inflation, and access the global economy.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-4">
    In places like El Salvador, Bitcoin has even been adopted as official legal tender. Meanwhile, everyday people in Nigeria, Kenya, Argentina, and Vietnam are using Bitcoin daily for payments, savings, and cross-border transactions.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-4">
    This global adoption wave shows that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative investment — it’s becoming real money. It offers freedom from high fees, currency devaluation, and limited financial services.
